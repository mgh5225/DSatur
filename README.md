# DSATUR Graph Coloring Algorithm

This repository contains the Java implementation of the DSATUR graph coloring algorithm. DSATUR is a heuristic algorithm used for solving the graph coloring problem, which involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

The DSATUR algorithm was proposed by Daniel Brelaz in 1979, and it is based on the saturation degree of a vertex, which is the number of different colors used in the neighboring vertices.
